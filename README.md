# Coronagotchi

A small handheld Corona Virus / COVID-19 tracker for Australia.

Runs on an RPi Zero and outputs to a Waveshare E-Ink display.

Currently it outputs to the console and generates a graph, as per screenshot below. Next step is to make it output the summary to the E-Ink display and figure out how to convert the PNG into an appropriate-pallette BMP for the display.
